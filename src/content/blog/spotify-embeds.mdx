	hi this is my first blog post! i suck at writing anything down anything so
	hopefully talking about random things helps.
</SideNote>

this all started when i wanted to display my favorite songs on my [/about](/about) page, i already have a spotify playlist of them so i could just use the official embed. the problem is that the embed loads **1.96 mb of minified javascript**.

<img
	class="m-auto"
	src="/blog/spotify-embeds/big.png"
	alt="spotify embed requests"
/>

...and also makes tons of strange requests back to spotify, is extremely loud (with no volume slider!), and preloads some songs. on my old site i just gave in and used the official embed, but after seeing that scraping spotify embeds was possible (thanks [l-m](https://me.l-m.dev/)!), i tried making my own.

<SideNote>
	all of that javascript is even more insane considering this was meant to be
	used on other sites, you'd think the multi-billion $ company would care
	about performance for a simple embed. but it's no secret that a lot of the
	web is getting megabytes of javascript larger, from complex frameworks and
	overkill libraries just to render mostly static sites. [tonsky already has a
	great article on this](https://tonsky.me/blog/js-bloat/).
</SideNote>

here they are!

<div class="not-prose space-y-5">
	<Playlist url="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2m2lebj9Lg6Riwfyv7G9AD" />
	<div class="h-[1px] w-full bg-white/10" />
	<Track url="https://open.spotify.com/track/1uIrEzzaygkxr6mntrf8jm" />
</div>

the track embed was made with 0 JS, and the playlist embed was made with 1.84kb (minified) of JS, that's 99.9061% smaller than the official embed, and i think it fits my site much better :)

	ill get the playlist volume slider done one of these daysâ€¦ (9/14/2024:
	done!)

## how

first, you can just make a fetch request to the normal embed url (either for a song or playlist) pretending to be a browser

```ts
const res = await fetch(
	`https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2m2lebj9Lg6Riwfyv7G9AD`,
	{
		headers: {
			"User-Agent":
				"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:124.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0",
			Accept: "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8",
			"Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
			"Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1",
			"Sec-Fetch-Dest": "iframe",
			"Sec-Fetch-Mode": "navigate",
			"Sec-Fetch-Site": "cross-site",
			Pragma: "no-cache",
			"Cache-Control": "no-cache",
		},
		method: "GET",
	},
);

const html = await res.text();
```

and in the html response you get back, at the end there's a magical script tag with the id `__NEXT_DATA__` that contains everything you need!

![response](/blog/spotify-embeds/json.png)

```ts
const json = html.substring(
	html.lastIndexOf(`type="application/json">`) +
		`type="application/json">`.length,
	html.lastIndexOf(`</script>`),
);

const data: PlaylistEmbedData = JSON.parse(json);
```

you can make whatever with this data now! i'd highly recommend caching it. you can cache song embed data much more aggressively than playlists cause those shouldn't change.

it's possible to make your embeds use 0 JS by using the native [&lt;audio /&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) element, which is what i do for singular song embeds. there's a pretty big problem when using **&lt;audio /&gt;** for each song in a playlist embed though, it might take safari 8 seconds to load your site sometimes (not an exaggeration).

<SideNote>
	yes i did pinpoint the loading times to the hundred **&lt;audio /&gt;**
	elements, safari really doesn't like that rendering that many....
</SideNote>

note that you can barely style **&lt;audio /&gt;** elements and the element looks very different across each browser. because of all that i used a bit of JS with [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) for my playlist embed, which gets server side rendered with [astro](https://astro.build/).
