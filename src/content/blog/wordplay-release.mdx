after around 6 months of on/off work, 2 frontend rewrites, a major backend refactoring, and the pain of asynchronous rust; i'm releasing wordplay!!

### https://wordplay.lol/

<video controls src="/blog/wordplay-release/wordplay.mp4" />

the server's written fully with rust and the frontend is made with typescript and solidjs.

[all of the source code is on github](https://github.com/skearya/wordplay), if you find any issues or have feedback, please use github issues or message me!

i'll very likely write more about my experience making wordplay, there's a interesting bit behind stuff like prompt generation, rejoining games, determining if some text is valid english, and deployment.
