a portfolio commissioned for a really cool designer

---

i transformed a detailed figma mockup for 3 screen sizes into a real site. made with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). uses around 10 lines of client-side js.
