caps lock is a useless key in a useful position. it might have been useful in a time of typewriters where continuously holding down shift required effort, but not anymore.

i have caps lock bound to <kbd>⌃⌥⌘⇧</kbd> and quick caps lock press bound to <kbd>Esc</kbd>, thanks to [hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app/) on mac. if you're on windows, [powertoys's keyboard manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager) should be able to help you out (though i haven't used it).

<SideNote>
	the chances of any keybinds conflicting with <kbd>⌃⌥⌘⇧</kbd> are hopefully
	0%

## app switching

i use [hotkey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotkey-app/id975890633) for binding keyboard shortcuts to the apps i use the most. no more alt-tab fiddling or switching to mouse to go the thing i want, just <kbd>Caps Lock + F</kbd> to instantly go to firefox, <kbd>Caps Lock + V</kbd> for vscode, and much more.

## window management

i use [rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for window management. no more mouse switching to move around, resize, and rearrange windows. side-by-side windows is as easy as <kbd>Caps Lock ←</kbd> <kbd>Caps Lock →</kbd>.

## vim / tridactyl

if you're here you probably know what vim is. reaching over all the way to escape instead of caps lock (which my pinky rests on) to enter normal mode is a crime.

if you also plan on using a computer daily for the rest of your life, you really should be making it as comfortable as possible to use.
