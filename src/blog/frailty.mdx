import AlbumOrPlaylist from "../components/spotify/AlbumOrPlaylist.astro";

last week on a bus ride, i decided to listen to an album titled frailty

i've been a fan of some of jane's popular songs (homeswitcher), and a [leroy](https://soundcloud.com/c0ncernn) (jane side project) FANATIC for a year. i don't know why i was holding off on listening to frailty but god i've been missing out.

it wasn't an album i fully fell in love with on first listen, its a lot to take in and its quite extreme sometimes, though it definitely caught onto me quickly.

jane's able to convey emotion in some of the deepest ways possible i've experienced from music while still making BANGERS. the album feels like the cover art: fuzzy, distant, and familiar sometimes. the production is super creative the entire way through, even after hearing 90% of the leroy discography.

favorite song is kodak moment, i truly don't know how to describe it so listen to the whole album :D

if the artist stock market was real i would dump everything in jane. not just cause of frailty, but because she pushes herself to make **completely** different kinds of music. like its still super hard to believe the same person made [magic i want u](https://soundcloud.com/janeremover/magic-x2), [move for me & the penultimate dagger](https://soundcloud.com/c0ncernn/s3-e11), and [eyes off the wheel, i'm a star](https://soundcloud.com/janeremover/e-o-t-w-i-a-s). it sucks loving an artist and 20 new songs later everything starts sounding the same, making everything less special. jane's the antithesis of that and i'm excited for whatever else she tries.
